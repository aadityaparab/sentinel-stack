# Compliance Evidence

**Aliases:** compliance evidence, audit evidence, SOC 2 evidence, ISO 27001, compliance artifact, audit preparation, control evidence, compliance documentation

**Maturity:** Production

**Description:**
Auto-generate compliance artifacts from guardrail detections, 4-eyes review gates, and DLP scans. Map control evidence to SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and GDPR Article 30. Generate evidence packages on demand for auditors. Track control effectiveness over time and produce compliance dashboards.

---

## Overview

Compliance is a byproduct of good operations. This skill turns every guardrail detection and human review into compliance *evidence* — the audit trail that proves you've implemented and are operating controls.

Instead of scrambling to gather evidence when auditors arrive, this skill:

1. **Auto-tags** every guardrail action with the control it demonstrates (e.g., "data blocking" → "AC-1: Access Control Policy")
2. **Maps** controls to frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR)
3. **Packages** evidence on demand for audit requests
4. **Tracks** control effectiveness (are controls actually working, or are we just logging actions?)
5. **Generates** compliance dashboards showing audit readiness

No spreadsheets, no scrambling. Evidence generation is continuous.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Auto-Mapping: Guardrail Actions → Control Evidence

Every guardrail action produces a compliance artifact:

**DLP Hard Block → Data Classification & Loss Prevention Control**

```
Guardrail Action:
  Timestamp: 2026-04-12 14:32 UTC
  Type: DLP Hard Block
  Trigger: Health records (PHI) classification detected
  Action: Data export blocked
  
Auto-Generated Compliance Evidence:
  Framework: SOC 2 Type II
    Control: CC6.1 (Logical Access Control Policy)
    Evidence: System detected and blocked unauthorized access to 
              classified health data, per organizational data 
              classification policy. Incident log entry: BLOCK-2026-1847.
    
  Framework: ISO 27001
    Control: A.9.1.1 (Access Control Policy)
    Evidence: Data access control enforced; unauthorized classification 
              prevented. System maintained tamper-evident log of block.
  
  Framework: GDPR Article 32
    Control: Pseudonymization & Encryption
    Evidence: System prevents exposure of PII to unauthorized channels.
              Hard block prevents any processing without proper safeguards.

  Mapping: [CC3.2, Article 30(1)(f), DE.AE-5]
  Follow-up: Assigned to Compliance Officer for manual review
```

**Behavioral Anomaly Detection → Fraud Detection & Investigation Control**

```
Guardrail Action:
  Timestamp: 2026-04-12 18:22 UTC

### 5. Control Effectiveness Tracking

**Skill tracks:** Are controls actually reducing risk?

```
CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS METRICS (90-day rolling)

Control: DLP Hard Block (Data Classification)
Objective: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

Metrics:
  Effectiveness: 100% (23/23 blocks successful; 0 unauthorized access)
  Detection rate: 23 incidents detected per quarter
  False positive rate: 0% (all blocks were legitimate blocks)
  Time to block: < 100ms (median)
  
  Trend (Last 4 quarters):
    Q4 2025: 15 blocks
    Q1 2026: 23 blocks (↑ 53%)
    Interpretation: More detections = more enforcement activity; 
                    either more violations occurring OR better detection.
    Root cause analysis: New healthcare client (vertical expansion); 
                        staff training gap. (MITIGATE: training in progress)

Risk Reduction Impact:
  Before control: 0 blocks, potential data breaches (unquantified)
  After control: 23/23 attempts blocked; 0 breaches
  Effectiveness: HIGH (preventive control working)

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Control: 4-Eyes Approval Gate (Segregation of Duties)
Objective: Prevent unauthorized financial transactions

Metrics:
  Transactions requiring approval: 18 (per quarter)
  Approvals granted: 16
  Approvals denied: 2 (flagged as policy violations)
  Approval time: 4.2 hours (median)
  Audit sample: 10/18 sampled; all correctly approved
  
Trend (Last 4 quarters):
    Q4 2025: 12 approvals
    Q1 2026: 18 approvals (↑ 50%)
    Interpretation: More high-value transactions; approvals working as 
                    designed. 2 denials indicate proper policy enforcement.

Risk Reduction Impact:
  Before control: Manual approval, risk of collusion
  After control: System-enforced segregation; documented audit trail
  Effectiveness: HIGH (operating as designed)
```

These metrics feed **audit readiness dashboards** and **board reports.**

## Outputs & Artifacts

- **Control Evidence Artifacts** — Auto-generated from guardrail actions
- **Framework Mapping** — Control → SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / NIST / GDPR
- **Audit Evidence Packages** — On-demand for auditor requests
- **GDPR Records of Processing** — Auto-maintained Article 30 records
- **Control Effectiveness Dashboard** — Real-time control performance metrics
- **Compliance Readiness Report** — Framework-by-framework status & audit readiness
- **Management Sign-Offs** — Approval trail (CRO, CISO, DPO)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Evidence is a byproduct.** Compliance artifacts are generated automatically; you don't create evidence, you enable operations that produce it.
2. **Audit-ready, always.** When an auditor arrives, your evidence package is ready. No scrambling, no gaps.
3. **Control effectiveness is measurable.** You can quantify whether controls are actually reducing risk, not just whether they exist.
4. **Framework-agnostic mapping.** Same guardrails map to SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and NIST; no duplicative effort.
5. **Continuous, not annual.** Evidence is generated continuously. Audits are a checkpoint, not the driver.
