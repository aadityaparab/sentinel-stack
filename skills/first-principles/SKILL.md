# First Principles: Governance Reasoning Framework

This skill applies first-principles reasoning to complex governance questions without clear precedent. It decomposes problems into foundational components, challenges assumptions, and builds reasoning from evidence rather than rules.

## When to Use First Principles

**Use this skill when:**
- Facing a governance question without clear policy precedent
- Policy doesn't clearly cover a new use case
- Multiple interpretations of policy seem valid
- Need to design new policy or control from scratch
- Weighing competing governance principles (transparency vs. security, innovation vs. risk)

**Don't use when:**
- Policy clearly applies (use guardrails instead)
- Precedent already exists (check decision audit)
- Time is critical (use quick decision framework instead)

---

## First Principles Method

### Step 1: Define the Question

State the core question clearly:

```
EXAMPLE: Can we use ChatGPT to auto-generate offer letters to candidates?

Core question: What are the governance requirements for using AI to generate employment offer documents?

Related questions:
- Is this a high-risk AI application?
- What oversight is required?
- What transparency obligations exist?
- What data handling controls are needed?
```

### Step 2: Identify Assumptions

Surfacethey assume:

```
Assumptions we might make:
1. "Auto-generation means no human involvement" (false — humans will review)
2. "AI can't be used for employment decisions" (false — can be used with oversight)
3. "We need full transparency to candidates" (depends on risk tier)
4. "Offer letters are low-risk outputs" (depends on how decision was made)
5. "We have authority to set this policy unilaterally" (may need legal input)
```

**Challenge each assumption:**
- Is it stated or implied?
- What evidence supports it?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- Would we still decide the same if this assumption were false?

### Step 3: Break Into Components

Decompose into fundamental elements:

```
Using AI to generate offer letters involves:

A. DECISION COMPONENT
   - Is offer letter a "decision" or a "document"?
   - Who decides the offer terms? (AI or humans?)
   - Can candidate appeal or negotiate? 

B. DATA COMPONENT
   - What data is input? (Candidate CV, job level, salary band)
   - What data is output? (Offer document with compensation, terms)
   - Is candidate data processed by external AI? (Yes, if using ChatGPT)

C. CONTROL COMPONENT
   - Who reviews? (HR person before sending)
   - Can they override? (Yes, document is editable)
   - Is decision binding after review? (Yes, sent to candidate)

D. REGULATORY COMPONENT
   - Are there employment law implications? (Yes, offer is contract)
   - Are there GDPR implications? (Yes, candidate personal data)
   - Are there anti-discrimination laws? (Yes, salary decisions)

E. TRANSPARENCY COMPONENT
   - Must we tell candidate that AI was used? (Depends on jurisdiction, risk tier)
   - Can we explain how salary was determined? (Maybe not if algorithm-based)
```

### Step 4: Apply First Principles

Build up from fundamentals, not from rules:

```
PRINCIPLE 1: Accountability
Question: Who is responsible if offer is wrong or discriminatory?
Answer: HR person who reviewed and sent it
Implication: That person must understand terms before sending
Control: Human reviewer can't be rubber-stamp

PRINCIPLE 2: Transparency  
Question: What must be disclosed to candidate?
Fundamental: They should know if decision-making logic affects their rights
Answer: If salary was set by algorithm, they should know
Implication: Disclose if AI was used in material decisions

PRINCIPLE 3: Non-Discrimination
Question: Could AI introduce bias in offers?
Fundamental: Equal pay for equal work
Answer: If AI calibrates salary by seniority/role consistently, likely OK
Risk: If AI learned from biased historical data, could replicate bias
Control: Test offers for disparate impact (gender, race pay differences)

PRINCIPLE 4: Data Protection
Question: Is candidate personal data handled safely?
Fundamental: Minimize use of personal data
Answer: Don't send full CV to ChatGPT if job description is enough
Control: Anonymize input to extent possible (use "Senior Engineer, $150-180k band")
```

### Step 5: Evaluate Options

Generate options and reason through each:

```
OPTION A: Don't use AI for offer letters
Pros: Eliminates all AI-related risks
Cons: Misses efficiency gains; adds manual work
First principles test: Is avoiding AI the only way to manage risk?
Verdict: Overly cautious — risk is manageable with controls

OPTION B: Use AI to draft, require human sign-off
Pros: Captures efficiency; maintains human accountability
Cons: HR still needs to review carefully
First principles test: Does human review ensure accountability?
Verdict: Yes, if review is meaningful (not rubber-stamp)

OPTION C: Use AI, full transparency to candidate
Pros: Highest transparency; complies with fairness principle
Cons: May worry candidates; doesn't add value
First principles test: Is transparency the only relevant principle?
Verdict: Yes, but transparency doesn't require rejecting the practice

OPTION D: Use AI for routine offers only (standard packages)
Pros: Reduces risk for most cases; humans handle exceptions
Cons: Need to define "routine"; complex offers still need work
First principles test: Does limiting scope to low-complexity cases reduce risk?
Verdict: Yes, but complex cases may benefit more from AI assistance
```

### Step 6: Synthesize Conclusion

Build your reasoned position:

```
GOVERNANCE DECISION: Limited use of AI for offer letter generation

REASONING:
1. Accountability: Human HR person reviews and sends all offers
2. Transparency: Disclose AI use in candidate communication (e.g., FAQ)
3. Non-discrimination: Test offers monthly for disparate impact
4. Data protection: Don't send full CVs; use anonymized summaries
5. Scope: Use for standard roles (IC1-L4); exceptions reviewed manually

REQUIREMENTS:
- AI-generated offer must be reviewed by HR Lead before sending
- Reviewer sees both AI draft and supporting reasoning
- Reviewer can edit any terms
- Monthly audit of all offers for: accuracy, disparate impact, consistency
- Candidate FAQs disclose "AI-assisted generation with human review"

RATIONALE:
- Respects all first principles (accountability, transparency, fairness)
- Captures efficiency gains (saves HR ~5 hours/week in routine drafting)
- Maintains human control over final decision
- Provides transparency without unnecessarily alarming candidates
- Detects discriminatory patterns through regular auditing

WHAT COULD GO WRONG:
- HR reviewer doesn't actually review (mitigation: spot-check, audit)
- AI generates discriminatory offers (mitigation: monthly disparate impact test)
- Candidate disputes, claims discrimination (mitigation: document review, offer rationale)
- Candidate is concerned about AI (mitigation: transparent disclosure)

MONITORING:
- Monthly: Review sample of all offers (10% random)
- Quarterly: Disparate impact analysis (salary by gender, race, tenure)
- Annually: Decision audit of HR reviewer effectiveness
```

## Socratic Question Framework

When reasoning through governance questions, ask yourself:

### Clarification Questions

- What exactly is being asked?
- What are we trying to achieve?
- What would success look like?
- What would failure look like?

### Assumption Questions

- What are we assuming to be true?
- Why do we believe that?
- What if that assumption were wrong?
- What evidence would change our mind?

### Evidence Questions

- What facts do we know?
- What facts are we inferring?
- What could prove us wrong?
- What haven't we considered?

### Implications Questions

- If we decide X, what follows from that?
- What principles support this decision?
- What principles contradict it?
- How does this affect other decisions?

### Justification Questions

- Why is this the right answer?
- Who might disagree? Why?
- What's the strongest argument against our position?
- Could we defend this decision to an auditor?

## Common Governance Dilemmas

### Innovation vs. Caution
```
Dilemma: Move fast with new AI tool vs. ensure all controls in place
First principles: 
- Risk management says: understand risks before deploying
- Innovation says: experimentation requires some risk tolerance
Resolution: Pilot program with time limit; use "learning by doing" with limits
```

### Transparency vs. Simplicity
```
Dilemma: Full disclosure vs. avoiding decision-paralysis
First principles:
- Transparency principle: affected parties deserve to know
- Autonomy principle: people can choose if informed
Resolution: Disclose material facts; don't disclose technical minutiae
```

### Control vs. Trust
```
Dilemma: Strict policies prevent good decisions; loose policies enable bad ones
First principles:
- Accountability: someone must own the decision
- Competence: trust people to make good decisions if empowered
Resolution: Clear guidelines + human judgment; audit for patterns
```
